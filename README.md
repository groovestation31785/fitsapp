* TDD test suite using RSpec 
* Version control: Git / GitHub

## Summary
I was able to work on this app on and off since Saturday morning. This is the final product that I came up with. The client can register with the site. There is an option to register as a trainer. After registering, the user can create new messages and send them to another user. The user can also see any messages sent to them.

## For the future...
* There would be more of a differentiation between a user and a trainer, except for a true or false value in the database.
* When making a new message, the writer must type the full name of the recipient with complete accuracy (spelling, capitalization, etc.). The message is not valid if the name is not exactly correct.
* Adding JavaScript would have made the look more dynamic with jQuery and AJAX.
